# TODO

This is just a list of stuff to not forget, especially when linking new dependencies into the iOS project,
without having linked them on Android.

These are the projects that _need to be linked and manually set up_ to build on Android:

- react-native-config
- react-native-app-auth
- react-native-blur
- react-native-onesignal
- react-native-maps
- react-native-linear-gradient
- lottie-react-native
